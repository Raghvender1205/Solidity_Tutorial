## Getting Started
If you working on VSCode as your Code Editor then 
Install ```Solidity Package``` from Marketplace
1. For the Compiler, I installed using NPM/Node.js
    * For that run the following command on your terminal
    ```bash
    npm install -g solc
    ```
    * For installing using either Docker or building from source refer this
    https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.6.1/installing-solidity.html

2. If you want tutorials and Examples on blockchain and Ethereum refer this
    https://ethereum.org/en/developers/
    * It contains both Tutorials and by using DAPP.
